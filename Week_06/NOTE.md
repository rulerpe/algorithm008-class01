### Dynamic programing:
- Simplifying a compliated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems (in a recursive manner)
- divide & conquer + Optimal substructure

- Dynamic programming and divide&conquer are basicly the same (only difference is Optimal substructure)
- commonalities: both look for recursive problem
- difference: DP finds optimal substructure, remove non optimal sulution on the way

- two ways of DP:
    - top down + memory
    - bottom up + loops

- DP template:
    - find sub problem
    - relate subproblem solutions, base case
    - dp function
